While the LSST Wide-Fast-Deep survey and accompanying Deep Drilling and minisurveys will be ground-breaking for each of these areas, there remain competing demands on the survey area, depth, and temporal coverage amid a desire to maximize all three. In this white paper, we seek to address a principal source of tension between the different LSST science collaborations, that of the survey area and depth that they each need in the parts of the sky that they care about. We present simple tools which can be used to explore trades between the area surveyed by LSST and the number of visits available per field and then use these tools to propose a change to the baseline survey strategy. Specifically, we propose to reconfigure the WFD footprint to consist of low-extinction regions (limited by galactic latitude), with the number of visits per field in WFD limited by the LSST Science Requirements Document (SRD) ‘design’ goal, and suggest assignment of the remaining LSST visits to the full visible LSST sky. This proposal addresses concerns with the WFD footprint raised by the DESC (as ∼ 25% of the current baseline WFD region is not usable for dark energy science due to MW dust extinction), eases the time required for the NES and SCP mini-surveys (since in our proposal they would partially fall into the modified WFD footprint), raises the number of visits previously assigned to the GP region, and increases the overlap with DESI and other Northern hemisphere follow-up facilities. This proposal alleviates many of the current concerns of Science Collaborations that represent the four scientific pillars of LSST and provides a Big Sky approach to cadence diplomacy.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A Cadence to Reduce Aliasing in LSST</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Keaton J.

The current aliases for each field can be computed during daytime from the history of observations. We can then calculate the times when additional observations would worsen or alleviate these aliases for different fields. The scheduler should give preference to observation epochs that lessen the effect of aliasing, while still meeting all other cadence requirements.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A Higher Cadence Subsurvey Located in the Galactic Plane</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">M.B.

The current baseline footprint for LSST’s main Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) Survey observes the sky below 0◦ declination, which includes only half of the ecliptic plane. Critically, key Solar System populations are asymmetrically distributed on the sky: they will be entirely missed, or only partially mapped, if only the WFD occurs. We propose a Northern Ecliptic Spur (NES) mini survey, observing the northern sky up to +10◦ ecliptic latitude, to maximize Solar System science with LSST. The mini survey comprises a total area of ∼5800 deg2/604 fields, with 255 observations/field over the decade, split between g,r, and z bands. Our proposed survey will 1) obtain a census of main-belt comets; 2) probe Neptune’s past migration history, by exploring the resonant structure of the Kuiper belt and the Neptune Trojan population; 3) explore the origin of Inner Oort cloud objects and place significant constraints on the existence of a hypothesized planet beyond Neptune; and 4) enable precise predictions of KBO stellar occultations.

The goal of this LSST cadence white paper is to determine which survey strategy will ensure the efficient selection and characterization of TDEs in the LSST Wide-Fast-Deep Survey transient alert stream. We conclude that the baseline cadence design fails miserably to 1) measure the u − r color and color evolution of transients, a critical parameter for distinguishing TDEs from SNe, and to 2) catch the pre-peak light curves of transients, an essential measurement for probing their rise times, which are in turn a probe of black hole mass in TDEs. If we do not harvest the fruits of the LSST transient alert stream with photometric classification and early detections, both TDE and SN science will be greatly limited. Hence, we propose for a “smart” and ”colorful” rolling cadence in the Wide-Fast Deep (WFD) Survey, that allows for efficient photometric transient classification from well sampled multi-band light curves, with the 20,000 deg2 survey divided into eight 2500 deg2 strips each observed for one year in Years 2-9, with the full WFD area observed in Years 1 &amp; 10.

These transients are generated during binary neutron star and potentially neutron-star black-hole mergers and are electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave signals detectable in nearby events with Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and other interferometers that will come online in the near future. Discovering a large population of kilonovae will allow us to determine how heavy element production varies with the intrinsic parameters of the merger and across cosmic time. The rate of binary neutron star mergers is still uncertain and . 15 events with associated kilonovae are expected to be detectable per year within the LIGO horizon. The rapid evolution (∼ days) at optical/infrared wavelengths, relatively low luminosity, and the low volumetric rate of kilonovae makes their discovery difficult, especially during blind surveys of the sky. With the current LSST cadence design, . 7.5 poorly-sampled kilonovae are expected to be discovered in both the WFD and DDF surveys per year, under optimistic assumptions on their rate and luminosity. We propose to adopt a rolling cadence for the WFD survey in which gi observations are taken for a particular 750 deg2 tract of sky every night for 10 consecutive nights, with the total yearly exposure time in gi being equivalent to the WFD baseline across the survey. We expect this strategy to return ∼ 272 GW170817-like kilonovae throughout the survey discovered independently from gravitational-wave triggers.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Active Galaxy Science in the LSST Deep-Drilling Fields: Footprints, Cadence Requirements, and Total-Depth Requirements</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">W.N.

The principal LSST surveys will have cadences too sparse and irregular to capture most of these phenomena. A novel idea is proposed here to observe a single Galactic field, rich in unobscured stars, in a continuous sequence of ∼ 15 second exposures for one long winter night in a single photometric band. The result will be a unique dataset of ∼ 1 million regularly spaced stellar lightcurves. The lightcurves will gives a particularly comprehensive collection of dM star variability. A powerful array of statistical procedures can be applied to the ensemble of lightcurves from the longstanding fields of time series analysis, signal processing and econometrics. Dozens of ‘features’ describing the variability can be extracted and subject to machine learning classification, giving a unique authoritative objective classification of rapidly variable stars. The most effective features can then inform the wider LSST community on the best approaches to variable star identification and classification from the sparse, irregular cadences that dominate the LSST project.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Continuous Cadence Acquisition of the LSST Deep Drilling Fields</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Keaton J.

This will allow LSST to resolve rapid stellar variability such as short-period pulsations, exoplanet transits, ultracompact binary systems, and flare morphologies, while still achieving the desired co-added depths for the selected fields. The greater number of observations of each Deep Drilling Field pushes these mini-surveys deep in terms of both sensitivity to lowamplitude variability and co-added depth. Saving the individual 15-second exposures will yield an effective Nyquist limit of ≈ 0.031 Hz (32 seconds). Resolved short-period variability of targets in these fields will aid the interpretation of more sparse observations of a greater number of variables in the main survey. If this cadence strategy conflicts with the science goals of individual Deep Drilling Fields, at least a subset of the additional observations of each field should be obtained continuously. This strategy should also be considered for the proposed Galactic Plane mini survey, which will observe a greater number of stellar variables and transients.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Deep Drilling Fields for Solar System Science</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">David E.

The recent discovery of a kilonova counterpart to LIGO/Virgo’s first detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from a double neutron star (NS-NS) merger also creates an exciting opportunity for LSST to offer a Target of Opportunity (ToO) mode of observing. We have been exploring the possibility of detecting strongly lensed GWs, that would enable new tests of GR, extend multi-messenger astronomy out to z &amp; 1, and deliver a new class of sub-millisecond precision time-delay constraints on lens mass distributions. We forecast that the rate of detection of lensed NS-NS mergers in the 2020s will be ∼ 0.1 per Earth year, that the typical source will be at z ' 2, and that the multiply-imaged kilonova counterpart will have a magnitude of AB ' 25.4 in g/r/i-band filters – i.e. fainter than the sensitivity of a single LSST WFD visit. We therefore advocate (1) creating a flexible and efficient Target of Opportunity programme within the LSST observing strategy that is capable of discovering sources fainter than single-visit depth, and (2) surveying the entire observable extragalactic sky as rapidly as possible in the WFD survey. The latter will enable a very broad range of early science that relies on wide survey area for detection of large samples of objects and/or maximizing the fraction of sky over which reference imaging is available. For example, it will enable prompt discovery of a uniform and all-sky sample of galaxy/group/cluster-scale lenses that will underpin LSST strong-lensing science.

In its current design, the HLS imaging survey (4 filters spanning 0.93–2.00 µm) will measure accurate galaxy shapes for weak lensing while the HLS spectroscopic survey will measure galaxy redshifts using emission lines redshifted to &gt; 1 µm. Both programs take advantage of WFIRST’s wide field of view, its extreme optical stability, and the low NIR sky background available in space. Considering only the cosmological science enabled by the HLS, we discuss the remarkable science impact of the WFIRST HLS and LSST combination. It goes well beyond the science enabled by any of the data sets alone. In particular, this combination will be critical for photometric redshifts (object by object or in cross-correlation), source deblending, galaxy shape measument validation, and modeling in the nonlinear regime. The key requirement is for the LSST WFD to overlap with the WFIRST HLS and observe in at least ugriz. The needs from the WFIRST side are met by what the LSST WFD survey is currently planning to do. We are documenting it here primarily to ensure retention of the features that enable these powerful WFIRST HLS+LSST scientific synergies as the LSST observing strategy is adjusted.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Enabling Deep All-Sky Searches of Outer Solar System Objects</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Mario Juri ́c, R.

To provide a quantifiable metric we present five survey options using only between 0.3 and 3.8% of the LSST 10 year survey. We also provide information so that the LSST DDF cadence can possibly be matched to those of Euclid in common deep fields, SXDS, COSMOS, CDFS, and a proposed new LSST deep field (near the Akari Deep Field South). Co-coordination of observations from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and Euclid will lead to a significant number of synergies. The combination of optical multi-band imaging from LSST with high resolution optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy from Euclid will not only improve constraints on Dark Energy, but provide a wealth of science on the Milky Way, local group, local large scale structure, and even on first galaxies during the epoch of reionization. A detailed paper has been published on the Dark Energy science case [1] by a joint LSST/Euclid working group as well as a white paper describing LSST/Euclid/WFIRST synergies [2], and we will briefly describe other science cases here. A companion white paper argues the general science case for an extension of the LSST footprint to the north at airmass &lt; 1.8, and we support the white papers for southern extensions of the LSST survey. We also endorse the white papers from the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) arguing for modifications to the Wide Fast Deep (WFD) and Deep Drilling Field (DDF) surveys, the Big Sky white paper, and the white paper from the WFIRST team arguing for a deep field on the Akari Deep Field South.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Investigating the population of Galactic star formation regions and star clusters within a Wide-Fast-Deep Coverage of the Galactic Plane</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Loredana Prisinzan and Laura Magrini</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://docushare.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-30483/prisinzano_starformation_gp.pdf\">Docushare</a></p></td></tr><tr><td> </td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">One of the aims of LSST is to perform a systematic survey of star clusters and star forming regions (SFRs) in our Galaxy.

We propose using the Wide–Fast–Deep survey that contains several nearby galaxies (at distances where the stars themselves are not resolved, i.e., beyond 20 Mpc). In the context of hierarchical 1 galaxy formation, it is necessary to understand the prevalence and properties of tidal substructure around external galaxies based on integrated (i.e., unresolved) diffuse light. This requires collecting observations on much larger samples of galaxies than the Milky Way and M31. We will compare the observed structures to the predictions of cosmological models of galactic halo formation that inform us about the number and properties of streams around Milky Way-like galaxies. The insight gained from these comparisons will allow us to infer the properties of stream progenitors (masses, dynamics, metallicities, stellar populations). The changes in the host galaxies caused by the interactions with the dissolving companion galaxies will be another focus of our studies. We conclude by discussing synergies with WFIRST and Euclid, and also provide concrete suggestions for how the effects of scattered light could be minimized in LSST images to optimize the search for low surface brightness features, such as faint unresolved stellar tidal streams.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">LSST Local Volume mini-survey</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Eric F.

LSST will reveal many Local Group satellites and tidal streams and aims to inspire progress in understanding these issues in the Milky Way and Local Group. Yet, it has become clear in the last few years that there are dramatic galaxy-to-galaxy variations in terms of satellite populations and past mergers (as quantified by stellar halos). Given these variations, it is unclear what features of the Local Group reflect galaxy formation processes and dark matter, and which are accidents of accretion history. A census of satellites, halos and faint tidal features for a sizeable sample of galaxies, with a range of halo masses and accretion histories, and as deep as our current census for M31, is required to answer this question. While LSST’s r and i-bands will resolve RGB stars in the halos and satellites of D &lt; 6 Mpc galaxies, LSST’s g-band WFD dataset will be shallower than all current resolved star surveys on 8-meter class telescopes, and will not provide the necessary star-galaxy separation and stellar population information that allows the community to capitalize on LSST’s investment. We propose a ∼ 87 hour mini-survey targeting the environs of ten nearby M∗ &gt; 2 × 109M galaxies to increase the depth in the g-band to match that of the r and i-bands for resolved stellar populations. This will reveal the 25-100 MV &lt; −6 satellites, new dwarf ultra-diffuse galaxies and faint tidal features that are required to connect our learning about dark matter and dwarf galaxies in the Local Group to the wider galaxy population.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">LSST Observations of WFIRST Deep Fields</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The WFIRST Deep Field Working Group, WFIRST Science Investigation Team Members, and Community Members: R.

With its wide-field near-infrared (NIR) camera, it will survey the sky to unprecedented detail. As part of normal operations and as the result of multiple expected dedicated surveys, WFIRST will produce several relatively wide-field (tens of square degrees) deep (limiting magnitude of 28 or fainter) fields. In particular, a planned supernova survey is expected to image 3 deep fields in the LSST footprint roughly every 5 days over 2 years. Stacking all data, this survey will produce, over all WFIRST supernova fields in the LSST footprint, ∼12–25 deg2 and ∼5–15 deg2 regions to depths of ∼28 mag and ∼29 mag, respectively. We suggest LSST undertake mini-surveys that will match the WFIRST cadence and simultaneously observe the supernova survey fields during the 2-year WFIRST supernova survey, achieving a stacked depth similar to that of the WFIRST data. We also suggest additional observations of these same regions throughout the LSST survey to get deep images earlier, have long-term monitoring in the fields, and produce deeper images overall. These fields will provide a legacy for cosmology, extragalactic, and transient/variable science.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">LSST Target of Opportunity proposal for locating a core collapse supernova in our galaxy triggered by a neutrino supernova alert</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">C.W.

When such galactic CCSNe happen, over 99% of its gravitational binding energy is released in the form of neutrinos. Over a period of tens of seconds, a powerful neutrino flux is emitted from the collapsing star. When the exploding shock wave finally reaches the surface of the star, optical photons escaping the expanding stellar envelope leave the star and eventually arrive at Earth as a visible brightening. By combining the multi-messenger signal from optical, neutrino, and gravitational waves, we afford an unprecedented opportunity to learn about the astrophysics of these rare objects. Carefully measuring the optical light curve of the explosion will give critical information about the size and composition of the progenitor star and help understand the dynamics of the explosion. Crucially, although the neutrino signal is prompt, the time to the shock wave breakout can be minutes to many hours later. This means that the neutrino signal will serve as an alert, warning the optical astronomy community the light from the explosion is coming. Quickly identifying the location of the supernova on the sky and disseminating it to the all available ground and spaced-based instruments will be critical to learn as much as possible about the event. Some neutrino experiments can report pointing information for these galactic CCSNe. In particular, the Super-Kamiokande experiment can point to a few degrees for CCSNe near the center of our galaxy. A CCSN located 10 kpc from Earth is expected to result in a pointing resolution of the order of 3◦ . LSST’s field of view (FOV) is well matched to this initial search box. LSSTs depth is also uniquely suited for identifying CCSNe even if they fail or are obscured by the dust of the galactic plane. This is a proposal to, upon receipt of such an alert, prioritize the use of LSST for a full day of observing to continuously monitor a pre-identified region of sky and, by using difference imaging, identify and announce the location of the supernova. In this proposal, we propose to use one night (approximately 0.03% of the survey period) if a galactic supernova occurs. Based on estimates of the rate of such CCSNe there is approximately a 20% chance that a CCSN will occur during the survey period.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Mapping the Periphery and Variability of the Magellanic Clouds</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Knut Olsen, Paula Szkody, Maria-Rosa Cioni, Marcella Di Criscienzo, Ilaria Musella, Vincenzo Ripepi, Francesco Borsa, Marcella Marconi, L ́eo Girardi, Giada Pastorelli, Michele Trabucchi, Paolo Ventura, Marc Moniiez</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://docushare.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-30645/olsen_mc_mini.pdf\">Docushare</a></p></td></tr><tr><td> </td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">We propose a combination of a modified Wide-Fast-Deep survey, a mini-survey of the South Celestial Pole, and a Deep Drilling-style survey to produce a 3-D map of the Magellanic System and to provide a detailed census of the transient and variable populations in the Clouds.

This increased area addresses a wide range of science cases that enhance all of the primary LSST science goals by significant amounts. The science enabled includes: increasing the area of the sky accessible for follow-up of multi-messenger transients including gravitational waves, mapping the milky way halo and halo dwarfs including discovery of RR Lyrae stars in the outer galactic halo, discovery of z &gt; 7 quasars in combination with Euclid, enabling a second generation DESI and other spectroscopic surveys, and enhancing all areas of science by improving synergies with Euclid, WFIRST, and unique northern survey facilities. This white paper is the result of the Tri-Agency Working Group (TAG) appointed to develop synergies between missions and presents a unified plan for northern coverage. The range of time estimates reflects synergies with other surveys. If the modified DESC WFD survey, the ecliptic plane mini survey, and the north galactic spur mini survey are executed this plan would only need 0.6% of the LSST time, however if none of these are included the overall request is 2.5% of the 10 year survey life. In other words, the majority of these observations are already suggested as part of these other surveys and the intent of this white paper is to propose a unified baseline plan to carry out a broad range of objectives to facilitate a combination of multiple science objectives.

The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) has been tasked with deriving constraints on cosmological parameters from LSST data. Each of the cosmological probes for LSST is heavily impacted by the choice of observing strategy. This white paper is written by the LSST DESC Observing Strategy Task Force (OSTF), which represents the entire collaboration, and aims to make recommendations on observing strategy that will benefit all cosmological analyses with LSST.

In order to reduce systematic uncertainties, we conclude that the current baseline observing strategy needs to be significantly modified to result in the best possible cosmological constraints. We provide some key recommendations: moving the WFD (Wide-Fast-Deep) footprint to avoid regions of high extinction, taking visit pairs in different filters, changing the 2×15s snaps to a single exposure to improve efficiency, focusing on strategies that reduce long gaps (&gt;15 days) between observations, and prioritizing spatial uniformity at several intervals during the 10-year survey.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Presto-Color: An LSST Cadence for Explosive Physics &amp; Fast Transients</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Federica B.

To date, not a single planet has been identified orbiting a (single) white dwarf (WD). Nevertheless, in the last two decades accumulating evidence has shown that the excess of metals that we see in the atmosphere of 30-40% of so called “polluted white dwarfs” is due to asteroid tidal disruption. The ongoing tidal disruption of a planetesimal has been watched live for the first time by K2 in WD1145+017. In contrast to observations of planets transiting main-sequence (MS) stars, which provide only mean densities (from mass and radius measurements) and some insight into the composition of their atmospheres, the study of debris-polluted WDs has already revealed that the bulk compositions of exo-planetary bodies resembles those found in the solar system, including evidence for water-rich planetesimals. The fact that Kepler/K2, observing in total about 500 white dwarfs, has found only one case of (irregular) transits tells us that WD transits are rare. TESS and PLATO, targeting bright stars, will not improve the situation much observing about 1000 and a few thousands WDs at maximum, respectively. Much larger statistics can be obtained only with LSST, allowing – for the 1st time – to study WD transits and start understanding what happens to &gt;95% of planetary systems (all those with a MS stellar mass below 8-10 M), when the host star evolves beyond the red giant phase, until it becomes a white dwarf.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Simultaneous LSST and Euclid observations –advantages for Solar System Objects</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">C.

However to date exploiting strong lensing as a tool for these numerous cosmological and astrophysical applications has been severely hampered by limited sample sized. LSST will drive studies of strongly lensed galaxies, galaxy groups and galaxy clusters into the statistical age. Time variable lensing events, e.g. measuring cosmological time delays from strongly lensed supernovae and quasars, place the strongest constraints on LSST’s observing strategy and have been considered in the DESC observing strategy white papers. Here we focus on aspects of “static” lens discovery that will be affected by the observing strategy. In summary, we advocate (1) ensuring comparable (sub-arcsecond) seeing in the g-band as in r &amp; i to facilitate discovery of gravitational lenses, and (2) initially surveying the entire observable extragalactic sky as rapidly as possible to enable early science spanning a broad range of static and transient interests.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Target of Opportunity Observations of Gravitational Wave Events with LSST</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The TVS Multiwavelength Characterization/GW Counterparts subgroup, Raffaella Margutti (chair, Northwestern), Section leaders: P.

Exploiting this breakthrough requires increasing samples to explore the diversity of kilonova behaviour and provide more stringent constraints on the Hubble constant, and tests of fundamental physics. LSST can play a key role in this field in the 2020s, when the gravitational wave detector network is expected to detect higher rates of merger events involving neutron stars (∼10s per year) out to distances of several hundred Mpc. Here we propose comprehensive target-of-opportunity (ToOs) strategies for follow-up of gravitational-wave sources that will make LSST the premiere machine for discovery and early characterization for neutron star mergers and other gravitational-wave sources.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">TDEs with LSST</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Katja Bricman and Andreja Gomboc</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://docushare.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-30574/bricman_tde_wfd.pdf\">Docushare</a></p></td></tr><tr><td> </td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">We investigate the prospects of observing Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) with different LSST cadences proposed with the White paper call.

We present a metric that quantifies how well parameters of a particular variability model would be recovered for a given opSim cadence.

We recommend precise multi-color grizy photometry as deeply as spatial crowding will allow (ideally completing early in the project), complemented by a single-filter survey spread over the entire 10-year time baseline. Both strands should cover as broad an area within the Bulge as possible, with image quality sufficient to reach at least the bulge main sequence turn-off in seeing-limited observations.

The choice between same-filter nightly pairs or different-filter nightly pairs in the Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) Survey will have a dramatic effect on the ability of the Moving Object Pipeline System (MOPS) to detect certain classes of Solar System objects; many of the possible filter pairings would result in significant (∼ 50% or more) loss of Solar System object detections. In particular, outer Solar System populations can be significantly redder than those in the inner Solar System, and nightly pairs in r-band will result in the deepest survey for the outer Solar System. To maximize the potential for outer Solar System science, we thus advocate for ensuring that the WFD survey contains a sufficient number of r-r nightly pairs for each field during a discovery season to ensure detection and linking using MOPS. We also advocate for adding additional spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that more accurately model outer Solar System populations to the pipeline for evaluating the outputs of the LSST operations simulator. This will enable a better estimate of how many Solar System population detections are lost or gained for different filter choices in the WFD survey.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The First Extragalactic Exoplanets — What We Gain From High Cadence Observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud?</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Radoslaw Poleski and Przemek Mr ́oz</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://docushare.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-30584/poleski_smc_mini.pdf\">Docushare</a></p></td></tr><tr><td> </td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">We propose to increase LSST cadence for the Small Magellanic Cloud which will enable finding dozens of microlensing events annually and potentially, a few planetary events over the course of the survey.

The adopted stellar tracers will be mainly red giants, pulsating variable stars of different types, and turn-off (TO) main sequence (MS) stars. In a synergistic and complemental approach, we have selected targets that host red giant branch (RGB) stars which are within the reach of Gaia and not yet (all) saturated with the LSST. In five of them we will reach at least one magnitude below the TO of the oldest stellar component (t ≥ 10 Gyr) with the LSST. Specifically, we plan to use pulsating variable stars populating the whole classical instability strip (namely: 1 RR Lyrae stars, Cepheids of different types, SX Phoenicis and delta Scuti stars) and Long Period Variables (LPVs), along with the Color Magnitude Diagram (CMD) of the resolved stellar populations in these 6 systems to: i) trace their different stellar generations over the large spatial extension and magnitude depth allowed by the LSST; ii) measure their distances using variable stars of different type/parent stellar population and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB); iii) map their 3D structures all the way through to the farther periphery of their halos; iv) search for tidal streams which are supposed to connect some of these systems; and v) study their Star Formation Histories (SFHs) over an unprecedented large fraction of their bodies. Our ultimate goal is: i) to provide a complete picture of these nearby stellar systems all the way through to their periphery, and: ii) to directly link and cross-calibrate the Gaia and LSST projects. A valuable by-product will be the derivation, for the first time, of period-luminosity relations based on statistically significant samples of delta Scuti and SX Phoenicis stars, in different environments.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Plane’s The Thing: The Case for Wide-Fast-Deep Coverage of the Galactic Plane and Bulge</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Jay Strader (Michigan State),, Elias Aydi (Michigan State), Christopher Britt (STScI), Adam Burgasser (UCSD), Laura Chomiuk (Michigan State), Will Clarkson (UM-Dearborn), Brian D.

The former one is aimed at constraining the 3D structure of the galactic Bulge across the four quadrants, and in particular, the transition between inner and outer Bulge. The u, g, r, i, z, y LSST bands provide fundamental diagnostics to constrain the evolutionary properties of low and intermediate-mass stars when moving from a metal-poor to a metal-rich regime.
